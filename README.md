# Tutorial on Iterative Generative Unfolding with CFMs for the PHYSTAT 2024 Conference on Unfolding
This repository is a small tutorial on the use of generative networks (Conditional Flow Matching in this case) for iterative generative unfolding presented at the [PHYSTAT 2024](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1357972/) conference.

CFM [[1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02747), [2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10475)] is a network that encodes a velocity field that encodes the time evolution between particle-level events and reco-level events.

This Repository is an OminFold tutorial meant to walk through the steps of using Omnifold for unfolding at the PHYSTAT 2024 conference.
